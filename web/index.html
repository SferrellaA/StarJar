    <li>YEARS OF REVERSE ENGINEERING yet NO REAL-WORLD USE FOUND for</li>
    <li>sure we are not relaying information that could be used against us</li>
    <li>security through obscurity</li>
    <li>cease and desist</li>
    <li>Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations parts ยง 1540.103(c) states: No person may make, or cause to be made any reproduction or alteration, for fraudulent purpose, of any report, record, security program, access medium, or identification medium issued under this subchapter. </li>
    <li>Computers were supposed to solve meath, not to be programmed</li>
    <li>C is a letter, not a language</li>
    <li>wanna print() something? Write in a paper with a pen</li> 
    <li>"I'n writing a recursive method with threads to optimize the cpu usage in a 0.02%" this is a nonsensical statement made by deranged people</li>
    <li>look at what programmers have been demanding your respect for, after all teh led lights we put in their computers:</li>
    <li>(this is real computer science done by real computer scientists):</li>
    <li>if programming was real how come nobody thought in DOING</li>
    <li>they played us for absolute fools</li>
